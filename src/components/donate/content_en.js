This implies creating documentation, lessons and articles on how things work, how to do this or that and why this or that decision is made.

A summary report will be published at the end of a month. All our work is open and can be followed on Github (for code), the site (for content), and social media (for news).
So, you can always estimate the amount of funds received by us and how we spent them.

As the project grows, we will apply for sponsorship to platforms supporting educational and open source projects.
At this stage, we are limited by a number of factors such as the lack of the Stripe payment system in our country and even a small number of stars on Github.
